# Predictive-Maintenance-of-Industrial-Machinery
## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict potential failures in industrial machinery before they occur by analyzing sensor data and identifying patterns that precede breakdowns.
Using IBM Cloud services and Watsonx AI, the solution provides failure type classification (e.g., tool wear, power failure, heat dissipation issues) to enable proactive maintenance, reduce downtime, and optimize operational efficiency.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Industrial machinery downtime leads to significant production losses and high maintenance costs.
This project builds a classification model that predicts the type of failure in machinery based on real-time operational data, enabling maintenance teams to take proactive measures.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
